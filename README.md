# VCV-Rack-Plugin-Project

## Project Summary
Learn to write modules for [**VCV Rack**](https://vcvrack.com/) using the resource [**Developing Virtual Synthesizers with VCV Rack**](https://www.leonardo-gabrielli.info/vcv-book) by Leornardo Gabrielli.

Project currently on hiatus until at least October to focus on other work.

Use that knowledge to write my own VCV Rack Plugin.

**Plugin** - A collection of modules that can be loaded into VCV Rack.

**Module** - Generates or processes signals using voltage as inputs and outputs.
