# VCV-Rack-Plugin-Project

## Project Summary
Learn to write modules for [**VCV Rack**](https://vcvrack.com/) using the resource [**Developing Virtual Synthesizers with VCV Rack**](https://www.leonardo-gabrielli.info/vcv-book) by Leornardo Gabrielli.

[**Project Plan**](https://awesome-open-22e.notion.site/11e712a36fce41f6aeee2a410547b7b0?v=28d2a3f22fa3497390d58e0509c2784c)

Use that knowledge to write my own VCV Rack Plugin.

**Plugin** - A collection of modules that can be loaded into VCV Rack.

**Module** - Generates or processes signals using voltage as inputs and outputs.
